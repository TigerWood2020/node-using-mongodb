# Using MongoDB with NodeJS Project
Make sure you have MongoDB and NodeJS installed on your system prior to start this project. 

## Setup steps
1. Install MongoDB community: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community
2. Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Run & Test
1. Run `npm start` first to make sure your project is started succesfully
2. Run `npm test` to test everything

## Notes about tests
It is completely normal to have some of the tests fail throughout a module (ex.: Module 3) while you complete your tests, `check your code` at the end of the module to have proper tests on your code.

## Branches
The branch follows the same modules on Pluralsight at the end, therefore the `Module-2` is the branch after the code for Module 2 has been completed.
